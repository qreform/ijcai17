This directory contains three different benchmark test-sets, each of which is
formed by three different folders: ALT for the alternating reformulations, CNF
for the cnf reformulations, and, finally, DNF for dnf reformulations.

The complete results (times and lengths) of each test set are contained in the
file Results.txt. The lengths alone are also listed in the file ResultsL.txt.
Finally, each solver has its own report: ResultDLV for the disjunctive-chase
approach; ResultMathSat.txt for the MathSat smt solver; ResultE.txt for the E
theorem prover; ResultVampire.txt for the Vampire theorem prover.
